    <h4>School Infirmary With Qualified Nurse</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The School Infirmary is looked after by a qualified nurse. Medical check-up of students are regularly carried out and a record is maintained. If the doctor is of the opinion that a child needs special medical attention, the parents are informed of the same.
      Parents are requested not to send sick children to school for attending classes or for appearing for examinations. This is in the interest of the child and at times his/her classmates, as well. Medical Certificates for his / her absence must be submitted so that the child’s results are not affected.
      All parents are requested to impart Health Education to their children.
      Annual health check up is conducted by the school.</p>
